# Guess-The-Number
Guess The Number is a Game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The game typically features a user interface that allows players to input their guesses and receive feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
This is a small project that I created with my friend @sannanumer2003 to improve our front-end skills.
